We want to do a range of runs, under the constraint of limited time and
materials.

Aims
----


1. Get a statistical number of single layer runs, say 10. Aim is to look at
turbulence statistics and structure of the current.

2. Perform a number of two layer runs. Aim is to look at velocity structure.

3. Refractive index match current and ambient / ambient lower layer.

4. Maintain relative density differences of at least 1.01




Constraints
-----------

### Time ###

8 days total.

With prepared chemicals, single layer runs take ~1 hour to fill, run and clean.

Two layer runs take longer, limited by the filling time which depends on the
lower layer depth. Ballpark is 2 hours.


### Materials ###

16 * 30kg = 480kg Glycerol (400L)

20kg MKP

Lots of salt.


### Preparation

Ideally we fill up the tanks with water and give them time to get
to near ambient temperature.

There are two 1800L big mixer tanks.

There is one 50L tank for lock fluid.

There is one 200L tank for lower layer fluid.

The flume uses about 250L of fluid in the ambient. This gives 6 runs per
big mixer tank if 50L is used to flush between runs.

This gives 10-12 runs from full mixer tanks.


Setup
-----

The two layer runs can be set up using either fresh water or salt water in the
upper layer. It is simpler to do fresh water but this means using larger
quantities of mkp / glycerol in the lower layers to ensure a sufficient
density difference between layers.

The process using salt water is to fill the upper layer using salt solution
from the large mixer tank (used for glycerol in the single layer experiments);
the lower layer is filled using the cylindrical tank.

Scientifically useful:

- capture each of the cases from wh2012
